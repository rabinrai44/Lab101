## Lab101 [Grand Circus](https://grandcircus.co) .NET(C#) Bootcamp Prework

### The C# Console Program - Math Challenge
The program read the two integers from the user with same number of digits `(example: number1 = 234, number2 = 564)` and check if each corresponding place in the two numbers (ones, tens, hundreds, ...) sums to the same total.
#### Examples:

 ```
 Program prints 'False'
 Number1 = 153, Number2 = 564 => 1+3 ≠ 5+4 ≠ 3+5 
 ``` 
  ```
 Program prints 'True'
  Number1 = 543, Number2 = 456 => 5+4 = 4+5 = 3+6 
  ```
